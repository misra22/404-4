Morgoth, with the aid of the monstrous spider Ungoliant, corrupted and destroyed the Two Trees of Valinor, Telperion and Laurelin, which were the sources of light for the Blessed Realm. These Trees stood in Valinor, the land of the Valar, where many Elves had settled. Their destruction plunged the land into darkness and led to Morgoth stealing the Silmarils, the three radiant jewels crafted by the Elf Feanor, which contained the last pure light of the Trees. This theft ignited the great struggle of the First Age, as FÃ«anor and his followers swore a terrible oath to reclaim the Silmarils, leading to the tragic wars and downfall of many Elven kingdoms in Middle earth.
